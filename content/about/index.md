Hello, my name is Pedro, but you can call me _torras_!

I'm an electrical engineer, currently working as a Embedded Software Developer for the automotive industry. I figured out a little too late into my college time that I wanted to work specifically with software engineering, so ever since I graduated I've been trying to learn the fundamentals and build knowledge whenever I can, so that one day I'll hopefully be able to fully migrate areas.

Thank you for checking out my blog, I hope you find something interesting.
