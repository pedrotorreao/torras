Hello, this is my first post, hopefully this time I got it right (not proud to admit that I struggled quite a bit)!

I'll be posting mostly about my learnings on software engineering in general, possibly some personal opinions and the occasional rant.

Anyway, just a regular blog, if it happens to be of help to someone, awesome! Otherwise, it will entertain me (for some time).
